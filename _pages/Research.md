My research focuses on stellar cataclysmic events such as neutron star mergers and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In particular, I study the dynamics of astrophysical jets launched by these explosive phenomena and their electromagnetic counterparts. Below is a summary of my work (intended for a non-expert reader).

### A Scenario to Explain the Mysterious *EP240414a*  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250316243H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani et al. 2024b</a>

*EP240414a* is an explosion discovered by the Einstein Probe mission, displaying features that deviate from standard GRBs. In this work, we proposed that these peculiarities can be naturally explained by a jet that was significantly weakened by interaction with extended circumstellar material (CSM). Our work highlights the importance of the CSM in shaping GRB jets.

### GRB Jet Propagation in Circumstellar Material — Solved Analytically  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250316242H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani et al. 2024a</a>

This work presents a generalized analytic model for GRB jet propagation through extended CSM. We used the analytic model to explore how the CSM properties shape the jet, identifying conditions for successful/failed jets and linking them to the diversity of observed transients.

### GRB 211211A: Engine-powered vs. r-process-powered Kilonova  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...971L..30H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani et al. 2024</a>

Kilonovae (KNe) are transients powered by the radioactive heating of freshly synthesized r-process elements. We found that the early emission in GRB 211211A cannot be explained by r-process heating alone. Instead, late-time energy injection from the central engine provides a more consistent explanation for its observed properties.

### Late Engine Activity and Neutron Star Mergers  
#### <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...963..137H/abstract" target="_blank">Hamidani et al. 2024</a>

Observations suggest that central engine activity can persist well beyond the prompt GRB emission. In this work, we investigated the observable signatures of such late-time engine activity in neutron star mergers, via analytic modeling of the late-time engine jet. I provided predictions for the resulting X-ray to optical emission, which will help us understand the GRB central engine and the nature of the merger remnant from future observations.
